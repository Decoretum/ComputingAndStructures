Bubble, Insertion, and Selection

A bubble sort is rarely used: itâ€™s most effective when the data value are already almost sorted.
A selection sort is used infrequently: while this algorithm is effective for very short lists, the
insertion sort is often superior. An insertion sort is useful if the data are already almost sorted, or
if the list is very short (e.g., at most 50 items).

Among the three preceding algorithms, only insertion sort is used in practice, typically as an
auxiliary algorithm in conjunction with other more sophisticated sorting algorithms (e.g., quick
sort or merge sort).


Insertion sort, merge sort, and bubble sort are stable. Heap sort and quick sort are unstable.
