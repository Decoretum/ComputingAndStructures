Three ways of Doing Merge Sort

NOTE: In a recursive function, after you return something, the function receiving the recursive result will
continue with the operations that are AFTER the variable containing the recursive call 

It's about the LAYERS. Once a "layer" of recursive call is finished, it returns "something", the layer above this layer
will do its operations (since the previous operation is a recursive call)

1. Merge Sort with a Third Array
- 3rd array is the sorted array product of 1st and 2nd array


Process Flow:
1. Split Array into equal halves
