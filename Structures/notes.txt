Linear Data Structures

elements are occur in sequential memory locations or are logically connected, such as stacks and queues

Stack
- elements inserted at the rear end
- elements popped/removed at the rear end as well
- LIFO

Queue
- elements inserted at the beginning (enqueue)
- elements removed at the rear end (dequeue)
- FIFO

Non-linear data Structures

elements are not sequential, such as trees and graphs
