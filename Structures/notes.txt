Linear Data Structures

elements are occur in sequential memory locations or are logically connected, such as stacks and queues

Stack
- elements inserted at the rear end
- elements popped/removed at the rear end as well
- LIFO

Use Cases:
recursion
• leeping track of function calls
• evaluation of expressions
• reversing characters
• servicing hardware interrupts
• solving combinatorial problems using backtracking

Queue
- elements inserted at the rear end (enqueue)
- elements removed at the front/top (dequeue)
- FIFO

Non-linear data Structures

elements are not sequential, such as trees and graphs
