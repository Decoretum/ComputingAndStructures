# ComputingAndStructures
Using the book <b>"Data Structures in Java"</b>, I will be traversing the topics in order to understand Java Data Structures and Algorithms. VSCode and Sublime Text were used as the Integrated Development Environments (IDE) for applying the concepts in the book. <b>Java and C# </b> were used as programming languages for this repository. I didn't pursue this for learning Java but for strengthening my foundations in <b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b> and other computing concepts. I believe that strengthening my foundation in this field would help me soar high in other fields of technology such as Network Engineering, Software Development, and Business Intelligence.

Personally, I've added notes and other text files to aid me in my learning that came from other sources. All solutions in this repository for the excises were from me. So far, these external sites have proved valuable to me: <br>

## Disclaimer
All the code files found in this repository was made by Gael Estrera. Few of the exercises and scenarios' code from the book were either tailor-fitted by him, but mostly he used a different code solution for a certain scenario presented in the book and then compared his solutions to the book's solutions. <br><br>

None of the code here are procured from any companies that Gael has worked in.
