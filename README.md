Using the book <b>"Data Structures in Java"</b>, I will be traversing the topics in order to understand Java Data Structures and Algorithms. VSCode was used as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for applying the concepts in the book. Obviously, <b>Java</b> was used as the programming language.
