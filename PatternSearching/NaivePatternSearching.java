 * 
 * Complexity Analysis of Naive algorithm for Pattern Searching:
    Best Case: O(n)
    When the pattern is found at the very beginning of the text (or very early on).
    The algorithm will perform a constant number of comparisons, typically on the order of O(n) comparisons, where n is the length of the pattern.
    Worst Case: O(n2)
    When the pattern doesnâ€™t appear in the text at all or appears only at the very end.
    The algorithm will perform O((n-m+1)*m) comparisons, where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.
    In the worst case, for each position in the text, the algorithm may need to compare the entire pattern against the text.
