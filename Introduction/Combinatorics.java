    Combinations can be confused with permutations. 
    However, in permutations, the order of the selected items is essential. 
    For example, the arrangements ab and ba are equal in combinations (considered as one arrangement), 
    while in permutations, the arrangements are different. 

    Permutations involve factorial.
    
    Mathematically, the formula for determining the number of possible arrangements by selecting 
    only a few objects from a set with no repetition is expressed in the following way:

    C (n, k) =   n! / (k! * (n - k))
    n = total numbers in a set
    k = the number of selected objects (the order of the objects is not important)

    Sum of all possible subsets (combinations) of a set of n elements:
    2^n = SUMMATION FROM K = 0 TO N of <C(n, k)>
